#tommorow you will need to call a python func 
#something like this
#
#
#@app.route('/Tutorial')
#def tutorial():
#    return render_template('sites/Tutorial/tutorial.py')
#                           ('dir_name')
#
#and in that file there will be a func that does something
#or code that does something
#
#
#Try to import a class etc.
#have fun :D

#Trying to put Blueprints into my project
#app.py needs to be more clear and less code, more readeable code and more put together
#
#For example:
#from the code inside tutorial.py to be executed in app.py something like this:
#app.register_blueprint(tutorial_Site)
#
#My plan is:
#In every .py files in sites folder to have something like that to be called by a Blueprints so that 
#app.py can have less code
#or in those .py files to be a func that gets executed
#
